		<h1>About me</h1>
		<h3>Working gives me a lot of skills and experience that I believe make me best suited for the job position that<br> is being offered as a web developer. </h3>
		<p>From the very begining I had interest on web designing. Even though in a fast job-growth market, that doesnâ€™t mean I should pay any<br> less attention to resume than other occupations. Plus, as I was able built and manage a lot of work from anywhere in the world, more<br> of these works will be outsourced to overseas workers in the near future. Unless the door is opened and get an interview, I am going<br> to land the perfect job or secure the role that gives me career the boost needed to get to the next level. Knowledge of and experience<br> with multiple programming languages and digital multimedia software is seen as critical requirements. Thus, I have  included this<br>relevent source of information in the technical skills section of my resume. Additionally, with the growing importance of mobile,<br> highlighting my ability to deliver responsive websites and thus, mobile apps can separate you from the crowds of applicants.</p>
